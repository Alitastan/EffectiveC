# Effective C An Introduction To Professional C Programming -- Examples

> Hello everyone! Effective C is a book written by **Robert C. Seacord**. The source codes provided [here](https://github.com/Alitastan/EffectiveC) are my collections while I was reading the book. I find this book very useful since it helped me to understand some topics where I had problems to grasp the idea behind them. It also improved my insight over C language and I feel lucky to be able to read this book! I highly recommend it to those who want to improve themselves.

*NOTES*
 * *The source code examples are taken from [Effective C book](http://robertseacord.com/wp/). Please note that some are my own implementations and not all of them are identical with the ones provided in the book.*
